# 📚 Advanced Git Workflows

A hands-on repository dedicated to mastering advanced Git concepts, history management techniques, and professional workflow strategies.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository serves as a Git experimentation lab focused on developing a deep understanding of version control best practices.

The goal is to practice and master:

* Interactive rebasing
* Commit squashing and reordering
* Rewriting commit history
* Revert vs reset strategies
* Conflict resolution
* Clean and atomic commits
* Professional branching workflows

This project simulates real-world scenarios where maintaining a clean, readable, and structured commit history is critical in collaborative environments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand how Git stores history internally
* Learn when and how to use `rebase` effectively
* Differentiate between `revert`, `reset`, and `amend`
* Maintain atomic and meaningful commits
* Practice resolving merge conflicts
* Explore safe vs unsafe history rewriting
* Improve overall Git discipline

---

### 🔹 History Rewriting

* Cleaning messy commit history
* Fixing accidental commits
* Changing commit messages
* Removing unwanted commits

### 🔹 Branching Strategies
